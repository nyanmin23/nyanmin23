# Hi there, I'm Nyan Min Htet (Jade) 🐸

I'm a soon-to-be Computer Engineering student who loves exploring the world of low-level programming and embedded systems. Let's push the boundaries of what machines can do—right down to the metal!

- ⚙️ I'm currently applying to universities and just finished high school  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **CS50x** and the **Java MOOC** from University of Helsinki  
- 🧠 Ask me about **AI**, **Operating Systems**, or **how to crash your machine with a buffer overflow**
