# Hi there, I'm Nyan Min Htet (Jade) 👋

I'm a soon-to-be Computer Engineering student who loves exploring the world of low-level programming and embedded systems. Let's push the boundaries of what machines can do—right down to the metal!

- ⚙️ I've finished high school and currenlty applying to universities
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **CS50x** from Harvard and the **Java MOOC** from University of Helsinki
- 🧠 Ask me about **AI**, **Operating Systems**, or **how to crash your machine with a buffer overflow**
- 📫 Reach me at: [nyanminhtet2304@gmail.com](mailto:nyanminhtet2304@gmail.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyanmin23)
